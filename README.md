# Liri-Node-App

Liri is a command-line app designed for Node that can enable users to find information
about movies, music tracks, and upcoming concerts. Liri takes the following commands:

## "movie-this" [movie title]

## "concert-this" [artist/band name]

## "spotify-this-song" [song]

![spotify-this-song](https://github.com/dimparato/Liri-Node-App/blob/master/screenshots/spotify-this-song.png)

## "do-what-it-says"
(reads information from a file named "ramdom.txt"*)

![do-what-it-says](https://github.com/dimparato/Liri-Node-App/blob/master/screenshots/do-what-it-says.png)

If no command is given, Liri will prompt the user for what he/she wants to find.
