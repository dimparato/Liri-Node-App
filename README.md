### Liri-Node-App

Liri is a command-line app designed for Node that can enable users to find information
about movies, music tracks, and upcoming concerts. Liri takes the following commands:

# "movie-this" [movie title]

![movie-this](https://github.com/dimparato/Liri-Node-App/blob/master/screenshots/liri01.png)

# "concert-this" [artist/band name]
# "spotify-this-song" [song]
# "do-what-it-says" (reads information from a file named "ramdom.txt"*)

If no command is given, Liri will prompt the user for what he/she wants to find.

All data gathered is stored in "log.txt".

*Note: The command and search string must be separated by a comma!
